# Customer Churn Prediction using Machine Learning

This project predicts whether a telecom customer will churn (leave the service) or stay, based on their service usage patterns and contract details. It is beginner-friendly and demonstrates a full ML workflow with deployment using **Streamlit** and **Docker**.

## Project Highlights

- Real-world customer churn dataset
- Cleaned, preprocessed, and encoded data
- Built and compared two models: **Logistic Regression** and **Random Forest**
- Simple and interactive **Streamlit web app**
- **Dockerized** for easy deployment

## What is Customer Churn?

**Customer churn** is when users stop using a service. Predicting churn helps companies take action in time to retain those users. In this project, we analyze features like tenure, monthly charges, gender, contract type, and internet service to predict churn.

## Technologies Used

- Python 
- Pandas, NumPy for data manipulation
- Seaborn, Matplotlib for visualization
- Scikit-learn for ML models
- Streamlit for frontend UI
- Docker for containerized deployment
